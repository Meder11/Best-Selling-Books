# Best-Selling-Books
I was able to harness the power of Python libraries like pandas to analyze data from a CSV file. Specifically, we did the following:

Imported book data about the top 50 books on Amazon from 2009 to 2019.
Explored and cleaned the data with DataFrame methods.
Exported the modified data to a new CSV file
